## Effective listening
Five skills for improved listening
1. Recall details
2. Understand the big picture
3. Evaluate content
4. Attune to subtle cues
5. Listen with empathy
### Recall details
Ase yourself: 
1. Do I need to take action on this information now or later?
2. What information do I need to remember in order to take that action?

- Practice this two ask yourself as see the weather forecast without watching and then see if you can recall the daily temperature for the week and take notes.

### Understand the big picture
Tips: Ask yourself: 
1. How will this information impact the company five years from now?
2. How would I explain this to someone outside the organization or this relationship?

- Practice by attending a lecture and describing afterward the key ideas presented.

### Evaluate content
The type of listening: 
1. Form an opinion; 
2. Decide between two positions; 
3. Assess strengths and weaknesses.

Ask yourself: 
1. Is the speaker making a visible argument?
2. Is the evidence presented recent, credible, and relevant to the topic?
3. Are both pros and cons presented?
4. Is the information misleading?
5. If this was a product, would I buy it?

- One big caution for critical or evaluative listening is not to get distracted by the delivery of the speaker or any other external factors.

- Practice by news or sports commentaries.
