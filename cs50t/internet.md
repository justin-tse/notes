### Home Network Breakdowm
### IP
### DNS
### Packets
Like the envelope, but all is used in bits.(0 and 1)
### TCP/IP
- Transmission Control Protocol slash Internet Protocol
- IP: Now among the roles that IP plays is to support addressing, and fragmentation, and a bunch of other things too.
- TCP:Among the roles that TCP plays is to ensure that packets can get to their destination.(TCP support something called sequence numbers in addition to any fragment identifiers that also allows to ensure that data gets to its intended destination.)
### Ports
- Port number
number 80 means HTTP, Hypertext Transfer Protocol(Web servers language)
HTTP response.
But now many websites is using SSL, or HTTPS, a secure connection (443)
Emails(25)
FTP, File Transfer Protocol and other Protocol have their own numeric port identifiers, and indeed that's all this number is.
### Protocols
Transaction, like culture in human shake that person's hand when they meet.
### UDP
TCP guarantee delivery but UDP not.
Real time servers like live video, movies...
### IPs in More Detail
IPv4 x.x.x.x(256x256x256x256 -> 4 billion IP addresses, 32bits)
IP version 4, or v4
IPv6 (128-bit addresses) (2^128 IP addresses)
- private IP address(most likely come from a home router, bussiness router or maybe your ISP)
addresss that starts with
10.
192.168.
172.16
### Routers
sometimes called gateway
like a table, excell.
And that table, generally has at least like two columns, one of which has an IP address or a prefix, second is where should go.
### Traceroute
### Undersea Cabling
### Cable Modern Demo
RJ11 telephone
RJ45 jacks internet cable
WiFi
DNS DHCP
### Network Switch Demo
For example, One RJ45 jack to share more RJ45 jacks
### Home Router Demo
Router
### Network Cable Demo
Have different color wires, some of them are used for transmission, some of them are used for receiving, some of them are used for not technically, which used for insulation and cancellation of what might otherwise be interference.
### Closing Thoughts and Homework
