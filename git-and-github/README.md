## 2021.01.27 git push large file warning
- 1. more than 50 Mb will be warning
- 2. more than 100 Mb will be error
- Solution
https://git-lfs.github.com/

1. Initial first time install
Homebrew: brew install git-lfs
MacPorts: port install git-lfs

2. First time using
```shell
git lfs install
```

3. Use Git LFS to select the file types in your respository
```shell
git lfs track "*.psd"
```
means all .psd files in your respository

If you want to track every respository
[source][https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes]

make sure .gitattributes is tracked
```shell
git add .gitattributes
```
4. Just commit and push to GitHub as you normally would; for instance, if your current branch is named main:
```shell
git add file.psd
git commit -m "Add design file"
git push origin main
```

## 20210210  brew update error
- Problem
```bash
(base)  ✘ XF@MacBook-Pro ⮀ ~/src/justin-tse/notes/edX/cs50t ⮀ ⭠ main± ⮀ brew update
Error: 
  homebrew-core is a shallow clone.
  homebrew-cask is a shallow clone.
To `brew update`, first run:
  git -C /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core fetch --unshallow
  git -C /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-cask fetch --unshallow
This restriction has been made on GitHub's request because updating shallow
clones is an extremely expensive operation due to the tree layout and traffic of
Homebrew/homebrew-core and Homebrew/homebrew-cask. We don't do this for you
automatically to avoid repeatedly performing an expensive unshallow operation in
CI systems (which should instead be fixed to not use shallow clones). Sorry for
the inconvenience!
