## [Notes](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/notes/2/)
### Home Network Breakdowm
### IP
### DNS
### Packets
Like the envelope, but all is used in bits.(0 and 1)
### TCP/IP
- Transmission Control Protocol slash Internet Protocol
- IP: Now among the roles that IP plays is to support addressing, and fragmentation, and a bunch of other things too.
- TCP:Among the roles that TCP plays is to ensure that packets can get to their destination.(TCP support something called sequence numbers in addition to any fragment identifiers that also allows to ensure that data gets to its intended destination.)
### Ports
- Port number
number 80 means HTTP, Hypertext Transfer Protocol(Web servers language)
HTTP response.
But now many websites is using SSL, or HTTPS, a secure connection (443)
Emails(25)
FTP, File Transfer Protocol and other Protocol have their own numeric port identifiers, and indeed that's all this number is.
### Protocols
Transaction, like culture in human shake that person's hand when they meet.
### UDP
TCP guarantee delivery but UDP not.
Real time servers like live video, movies...
### IPs in More Detail
IPv4 x.x.x.x(256x256x256x256 -> 4 billion IP addresses, 32bits)
IP version 4, or v4
IPv6 (128-bit addresses) (2^128 IP addresses)
- private IP address(most likely come from a home router, bussiness router or maybe your ISP)
addresss that starts with
10.
192.168.
172.16
### Routers
sometimes called gateway
like a table, excell.
And that table, generally has at least like two columns, one of which has an IP address or a prefix, second is where should go.
### Traceroute
traceroute  128.32.203.137
traceroute  www.berkeley.edu
we can see how many router from our home router to walk until we go to www.berkeley.edu

### Undersea Cabling
### Cable Modern Demo
RJ11 telephone
RJ45 jacks internet cable
WiFi
DNS DHCP
### Network Switch Demo
For example, One RJ45 jack to share more RJ45 jacks
### Home Router Demo
Router
### Network Cable Demo
Have different color wires, some of them are used for transmission, some of them are used for receiving, some of them are used for not technically, which used for insulation and cancellation of what might otherwise be interference.
### Closing Thoughts and Homework

In a sentence that a non-technical friend or family member would understand, what is the internet?

Internet is a tool which can let you use your computer to communicate with different people in different places in the world.


What does it mean if a URL begins with https:// as opposed to http://? 如果 URL 以 https://开头，而不是以 http://开头，这意味着什么？
URL begins HTTP means it is using hypertext text transfer protocol, port 80.  HTTPS means it is HTTP and also using SSL, a secure connection, port 443.

What does a DHCP server do? DHCP 服务器做什么？



What problem is IPv6 attempting to solve? IPv6试图解决什么问题？

IPv4 uses 32 bits  IP address that we can only contain about 4.3 billion different IP address. But when more and more devices are used to connect to the Internet. We have more than 7 billion people and many people have more than one device.  So 4.3 billion is not enough for us to use. However, IPv6 uses 128 bits IP address, so we can contain about  2^128 different IP address. Therefore, we can solve this problem the more and more devices need to connect the Internet.
